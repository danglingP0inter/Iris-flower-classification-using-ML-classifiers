# Iris-flower-classification-using-ML-classifiers
Implementing k â€“ Nearest Neighbor classifier from scratch to classify data from the famous IRIS dataset of scikit-learn.

Some lines of the code has been made comment deliberately. You can uncomment these to compare the accuracy of this model with default kNN implementation provided by scikit-learn.

Among all well-known ML classifiers, kNN is found to be performing best on this perticular dataset.

For 80:20 train-test split, kNN model has accuracy of 93.3%.
